This is where I document my studies, learnings on Linux


$ cd /home/raybaba/
Press TAB twice and it will show all dirs in $ cd /home/raybaba/

ls: list all dirs
$ cd Desktop/
This goes to the Desktop dir

cd /: This takes one to the root dir
Windows machine use backlash eg
cd \ProgramFiles

cd ..  : This takes one back to the last dir

[raybaba@localhost /]$ cd ~ : This takes one back to the root dir

[raybaba@localhost /]$ cd ~/Desktop  : This takes one straight to any directory you want


[raybaba@localhost /]$ ls -l
Shows more details, rights etc of each directory. It is more verbose than mere typing [raybaba@localhost /]$ ls

[raybaba@localhost var]$ ls -lha
[raybaba@localhost var]$ ls -la
[raybaba@localhost var]$ ls -lah

Boths commands show more info as well as file sizes in human readable format

[raybaba@localhost var]$ ls --help
This is a way to get more information on a command
